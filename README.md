Welcome to my WordPress Plugins Collection
=================
Introduction
-------------

This is a collection of my WordPress Plugins created by me. I've created various plugins for Event registration, User enrolment, Booking and Appointment Forms. These plugins use jQuery Ajax and short-codes to embed forms in a Page. WordPress Settings page is used to create new Events, Event date, specify maximum seats available, etc. Users can then enrol for these Events through the User Enrolment Form embedded in a Page using short-code. User enrolments can be restricted through maximum seats available for the Event.

> **Features:**

Security checks at multiple points:
Form submission check, request URL check, Ajax call check, direct PHP page check, user logged in check, user roles and permissions check and much more.

Create custom forms using Bootstrap and specify in frontend-page-template.php

Handle backend form and database processing in processForm1.php

Specify multiple routes to route Ajax requests to different backend processing PHP files. Requests will invoke processForm1.php, processForm2.php, etc based on route specified in Ajax call and in the Ajax handler.
